# Bitquant Auto Bot

An automated Node.js script designed to perform daily interactions on the Bitquant platform to farm points. It cycles through multiple wallets, uses proxies, and simulates chat activity.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-Wallet Support**: Automatically cycles through all private keys listed in your configuration.
-   **Proxy Integration**: Uses proxies from a `proxies.txt` file to avoid IP-based rate limiting. Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS protocols.
-   **Automated Chat**: Performs a set number of daily chat interactions using customizable prompts from `messages.txt`.
-   **Detailed Logging**: Provides rich, colorful console output with status icons and a loading spinner for a clear view of the bot's operations.
-   **24-Hour Cooldown**: After processing all wallets, a 24-hour countdown timer begins for the next cycle.
-   **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles common errors and continues processing the next wallet.
